# Contact Me Contact Form
A beautiful, simple contact form made using PHP, HTML5, CSS &amp; Javascript

Adding a custom contact form to your website, without any 3rd party apps getting in the way, should be simple and easy. That's what this is - a contact form - simple.

To get this up and running you'll need a web server running PHP. After that copy this whole directory to your web server and load up the contact.php page, if you see some input boxes and a submit button then your web server is set up correctly. Not everything will be working at this point though, you'll need to follow the instructions below.

To get this set up and working with your own email address you will need to go into the config.php file and change the variables to match your own settings. The config.php file has been commented to guide you through the set up process, if you have any questions just ask!
